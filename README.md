# APIForge

APIForge is a Python-based automated testing framework for RESTful APIs, designed for simplicity and extensibility. It supports test generation, detailed reporting, and CI/CD integration, making API testing fast and reliable. It sends HTTP requests to an API (e.g. a `GET` request) and checks if the responses match expectations (e.g. Status code `200` and valid JSON data).

## Features
- Automatic test generation from OpenAPI specs
- Support for multiple HTTP methods and authentication
- Detailed test reports and logging
- CI/CD-ready with GitHub Actions

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
