      def log_api_result(self, test: Dict[str, Any], result: Any, success: bool):
          start_time = time.time()
          with self.lock:
              status = "PASS" if success else "FAIL"
              self.results.append({
                  "method": test["method"],
                  "endpoint": test["endpoint"],
                  "success": success,
                  "result": result,
                  "response_time": time.time() - start_time
              })
      def generate_html_report(self):
          env = Environment(loader=FileSystemLoader("templates"))
          template = env.get_template("report.html")
          with open(f"{self.output_dir}/report.html", "w") as f:
              f.write(template.render(results=self.results, timestamp=time.time()))
      def generate_json_report(self):
          with open(f"{self.output_dir}/report.json", "w") as f:
              json.dump(self.results, f, indent=2)
  ```
- Create `templates/report.html`:
  ```html
  <html>
  <head><title>Apifogre Test Report</title></head>
  <body>
      <h1>Apifogre Test Report</h1>
      <table border="1">
          <tr><th>Method</th><th>Endpoint</th><th>Status</th><th>Response Time</th></tr>
          {% for result in results %}
          <tr>
              <td>{{ result.method }}</td>
              <td>{{ result.endpoint }}</td>
              <td>{{ "PASS" if result.success else "FAIL" }}</td>
              <td>{{ result.response_time | round(3) }}s</td>
          </tr>
          {% endfor %}
      </table>
